**Elixir Fetcher**

This project is a simple React application that fetches and displays different elixirs from the Wizard World API (https://wizard-world-api.herokuapp.com/swagger/index.html). Each elixir is shown in a carousel with navigation arrows, and users can click a button to reveal the ingredients of each elixir. The project uses react-slick for the carousel functionality and fetch for API requests. To run the project, install the dependencies with npm install and start the development server with npm start.
